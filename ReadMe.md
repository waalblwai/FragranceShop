Project Two: Item Catalog - Fragrance Shop App
This WEB APP is part of the Fullstack Nanodegree Udacity. In this project, I made a full web application to list fragrances with its brands, and provide the user the ability to register to add, update and delete their brands or fragrances. Along with having the ability to use the api and receive json file with all their brands nor fragrances.
